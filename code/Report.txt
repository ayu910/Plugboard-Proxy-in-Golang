Homework 4: Plugboard Proxy


Implementation Logic :
1. Flag parsing is used to parse all the arguments.
2. If a listenport is provided then go in reverse proxy mode else work in client mode.
3. In client mode
	1. Open a TCP connection
	2. Get password from file passed as argument and send to encrypter
	3. Get the input from stdin and pass to encryter
	4. Encrypter will encrypt the text and send output.
	5. Pass this output to destination:port provided in command line arguments.
4. In Reverse Proxy mode
	1. Get password from file passed as argument and send to encrypter
	2. Open a listening port and run for loop to accept multiple sclient connections
	3. If connection is found, start 2 way communication.
	4. First read buffer sent from client, decrypt it, and send to destination:port specified in arguments.
	5. Second, get reponse from the destination and forward that to client.

Encrypter Logic:
1. Salt is hardcoded.
2. Nonce is generated using the data provided in stdin (because it should be unique for msg from different clients)
3. Generate key using pbkdf2
4. Get ciphertext using gcm.Seal

Decrypter Logic:
1. Salt is hardcoded.
2. Nonce is generated using the data provided in read buffer from clients (because it should be unique for msg from different clients)
3. Generate key using pbkdf2
4. Get plaintext using gcm.Open


To Run Use below Testcase :
0) In first terminal window
python3 -m http.server 7777
1) In second terminal window
./pbproxy -l 5000 -p pass localhost 7777
2) In third terminal window
./pbproxy -p pass localhost 5000
